# MTGA

Read public X (Twitter) posts on Android, with no account, no tracking and no ads.

## What you can do

- **Follow accounts** without an X account. Your list stays on your phone.
- **Read everything in one place.** Home shows all the accounts you follow, newest first. Pull down to refresh.
- **Filter Home**: media only, hide replies, hide reposts.
- **Look up any account** from the Accounts tab before deciding to follow it.
- **Open a post** to read it in full, copy its text, share it or open it on X.
- **View photos and videos** full screen, zoom in, and save them to your phone.
- **Read offline.** Posts you have seen are saved on the phone and stay readable without a connection.
- **Choose your look**: light, dark, pure black, and colours that follow your wallpaper.

## Privacy

- No account, no sign in, no ads, no analytics, no crash reporting.
- Only two permissions: internet access and network status.
- The accounts you follow and the posts you saved never leave your phone.
- Posts are read from public servers (see below). The option "Newest posts from X" in Settings reads the latest posts straight from X, which is faster but lets X see your IP address. You can turn it off.

## Where the posts come from

X no longer lets anyone read without an account. MTGA reads the same public posts through independent servers run by volunteers (Nitter servers such as xcancel.com), and directly from X for the newest posts when you allow it.

These servers sometimes slow down or go offline. When that happens, MTGA tells you which one and why, keeps showing your saved posts, and switches to another server. **Settings > Connection check** shows the state of each server.

Some servers occasionally ask for a **quick check** to confirm a real person is reading. MTGA usually does it by itself. If it can't, tap "Do the check" once and it is remembered.

## Install

Download the latest APK from the [Actions](https://github.com/213YaZ786/MTGA/actions) tab (open the most recent successful run, then the file under "Artifacts") and install it. Android 12 or newer is required.

## Having a problem?

Open **Settings > Activity log**, tap "Save to Downloads", and attach the file to an issue. It lists what the app asked each server and what came back. It contains no personal data beyond the accounts you opened.

## For developers

Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, single module. Build with Android Studio or:

```
gradle :app:assembleDebug
```

Gradle 9.5.1 and AGP 8.13 are pinned on purpose. Do not accept Android Studio's upgrade prompts. CI builds a debug APK on every push. For a signed release, add the repository secrets `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS` and `KEY_PASSWORD`.
