 * is faster to read than opening a database, adds no code generation to the
 * build, and keeps everything the app stores inspectable. Room earns its place
 * when full text search across the archive arrives, not before.
 *
 * Lives in filesDir, not cacheDir, because the system is free to delete cacheDir
 * under storage pressure and an offline reader that loses its content when the
 * phone gets full is not much of an offline reader.
