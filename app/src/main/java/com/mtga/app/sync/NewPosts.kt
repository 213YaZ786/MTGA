 * Decides which posts are worth a notification. Pure, so it can be run

 *
 * A post is new for an account when its id was not stored before the check,
 * it is newer than the newest post already stored for that account, and it is
 * newer than the moment notifications were turned on. The second rule keeps
 * a Nitter page that reaches further back than the cache from being read as
 * twenty new posts. An account with nothing stored yet announces nothing:
 * its first fetch is a backlog, not news. Pinned posts are old by nature.
