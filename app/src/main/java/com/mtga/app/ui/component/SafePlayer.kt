/**
 * A player for films and sounds from outside. Media3 reads the file itself
 * in Kotlin and Java, where a crafted file can only throw, and hands the
 * picture and the sound to Android's own decoders, which run in a
 * sandboxed system process updated every month. On top of that it only
 * knows the formats a message or a post comes in: the other readers Media3
 * carries (streams, old containers) are left out, so a file pretending to
 * be one of them is never parsed. No decoder of our own, ever.
 *
 * Shared across the apps of this base: edit Modules/shared, then run sync.sh.
