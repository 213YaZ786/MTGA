/**
 * The pull to refresh indicator, with the app's own loading mark in place of
 * the spinner: the mark follows the pull, as far as it has gone, then plays
 * on its own while the refresh runs. Placed like the standard indicator,
 * sliding down from the top edge of its box in a small raised disc.
 *
 * The hand feels the threshold: a crisp tick when the pull has gone far
 * enough to refresh on release, a faint one if it is brought back short.
 * Only the reader's own drag does that, not the indicator settling or
 * leaving on its own.
 *
 * Each app draws its mark in LoadingMark, with the same parameters.
