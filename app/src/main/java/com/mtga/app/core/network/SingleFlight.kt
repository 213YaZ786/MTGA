/**
 * Keyed single-flight execution: concurrent [run] calls for the same key share one execution of
 * the block, so duplicate work is coalesced, including across poll ticks when a slow execution
 * outlives its caller's retry interval. Entries clear themselves on completion, so a later call
 * runs fresh.
 *
 * Failures resolve to null for every joined caller (logged once), retry policy is left to
 * callers.
 *
 * Concurrency-safe: the in-flight map is a [ConcurrentHashMap], whose atomic `computeIfAbsent`
 * coalesces racing callers, so [run] may be invoked concurrently from any context. The coalesced
 * block always runs on [scope]'s dispatcher, not the caller's. A caller that leaves while waiting
 * does not cancel the block: it lives in [scope] until done.
 *
 * Ported from OneBusAway's SingleFlight:
 * https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/blob/main/onebusaway-android/src/main/java/org/onebusaway/android/util/SingleFlight.kt#SingleFlight
 * (Apache-2.0). One change, from Go's singleflight (BSD-3-Clause):
 * https://github.com/golang/sync/blob/master/singleflight/singleflight.go#doCall
 * (`if g.m[key] == c { delete(g.m, key) }`): the entry is removed only if it still
 * holds this very call, never a newer one for the same key.
