/**
 * Answers two questions about the device's network.
 *
 * Is there a usable transport at all. Asked before blaming an instance, so
 * "you are offline" and "xcancel is down" never get confused with each other.
 *
 * Is it metered. Live, for "media on Wi-Fi only". Metered rather than
 * "not Wi-Fi", because that is what the reader means: a phone hotspot is Wi-Fi
 * and costs data, an unlimited Ethernet dongle is not Wi-Fi and costs nothing.
 * Android knows which is which, the transport name does not.
