/**
 * The files automatic saving has asked for, so a later pass does not ask again.
 *
 * Without it a pass over the stored posts would queue a file still downloading,
 * and a file that always fails (a video removed from X) would sit at the head of
 * the newest first list at every opening and starve everything older. A name
 * asked for stays out of the passes for [BACKOFF_MILLIS]: long enough for the
 * system's downloader to finish or give up, short enough that a file lost to a
 * bad network gets another go.
 *
 * One small JSON file in the app's no backup folder, written in one step
 * (writeTextAtomically), the same shape as the notes of SaveOriginStore:
 * https://github.com/213YaZ786/MTGA/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/mtga/app/core/media/SaveOrigin.kt
