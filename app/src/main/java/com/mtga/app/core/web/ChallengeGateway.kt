/**
 * Fetches a page, and when a bot check stands in the way, gets through it.
 *
 * Order of preference, cheapest first:
 * 1. Native request. If the host was cleared earlier, it carries the cookie.
 * 2. On a check, one offscreen WebView load of the same URL. Its HTML is the
 *    page itself, so it is used directly and no second request is spent.
 * 3. If a host keeps challenging the native client even with the cookie, the
 *    fingerprint is being checked per request. That host is then read through
 *    the WebView for the rest of the session, still offscreen, still parsed
 *    natively. The WebView is a transport here, never a screen.
 *
 * Only GET pages go through here. Callers keep their own parsing and error
 * mapping. The returned body may still be a check, and [ChallengeDetector]
 * inside the error mapper will name it.
