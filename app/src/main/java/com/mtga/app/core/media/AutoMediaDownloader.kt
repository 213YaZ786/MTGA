/**
 * Saves the media of posts, without being asked, so they can be read with no
 * network: first the posts that have just arrived, then the stored posts whose
 * media is still missing.
 *
 * Into the app's own folder through [OfflineMedia], never into Downloads: the
 * point is offline reading, not filling the reader's drawer. A video is saved
 * with its still, so the post shows its picture offline too.
 *
 * Driven by a refresh of Home and by nothing else. There is no service, no
 * scheduled job and no work manager task behind this: with the app off screen
 * nothing downloads, which is the app's own rule and is stated here so the
 * next reader of this file does not go looking for the missing worker. The
 * catch-up pass is the same: it runs inside the refresh's call, on the app's
 * scope, ends with it, and the files it did not reach wait for the next
 * opening.
 *
 * What it saves is bounded three ways. A watermark, so only what is newer
 * than the moment the option was switched on is ever considered for the first
 * pass. A cap per pass, so one refresh after a week away does not queue a
 * thousand files at once, the rest following on later refreshes. And the
 * network rule the reader chose, for both passes.
 *
 * The catch-up pass follows AntennaPod's automatic download algorithm step by
 * step: the network and power gate, the candidates, dropping what is already
 * downloaded or has no media, the cap on what is left, then queueing:
 * https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/net/download/service/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/net/download/service/episode/autodownload/AutomaticDownloadAlgorithm.java#autoDownloadUndownloadedItems
 * The first pass and the stills are this file's own, which it adapts:
 * https://github.com/213YaZ786/MTGA/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/mtga/app/core/media/AutoMediaDownloader.kt
