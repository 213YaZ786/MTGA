/**
 * Settles the saves of [SaveOrigin] when a download finishes.
 *
 * DownloadManager sends ACTION_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE to the app that asked for
 * the download (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager#ACTION_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE),
 * so the app is woken only by its own downloads. The work is a few queries
 * and one update, done on a thread of its own while goAsync keeps the
 * receiver alive
 * (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver#goAsync()).
 *
 * Declared in the manifest as exported, which a system broadcast needs, and
 * protected by android.permission.SEND_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETED_INTENTS, which only
 * the system's download provider holds: no other app can reach it.
